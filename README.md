# E-commerce-Analysis: User Behavior & Conversion Metrics
## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing user behavior and conversion metrics on an e-commerce platform. The goal is to provide insights into user interactions, conversion performance, and purchasing behavior.
Main Objectives:
- Gain a deeper understanding of user behavior on the website.
- Measure metrics like bounce rate, revenue, and purchase performance.
- Provide recommendations to optimize user experience and revenue
Tools Used:
- Google Cloud BigQuery
- SQL
## Dataset
Data Source: A simulated dataset that simulates data from an e-commerce site that includes information about visits, user behavior, and purchases.
Data Preprocessing: Data is cleaned before querying to ensure accuracy, including checking for null values, removing invalid data, and standardizing formats.
